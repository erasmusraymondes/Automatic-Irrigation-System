#Automatic-Irrigation-System-(Arduino)

This project involves designing an automated irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system utilizes soil moisture sensors to monitor soil conditions and automatically activates a water 
pump or irrigation valve when the soil moisture level drops below a predefined threshold. The Arduino manages the sensor readings and controls the irrigation process to ensure optimal soil moisture for 
plant health. This project demonstrates the application of Arduino in creating efficient, automated solutions for agricultural and gardening needs.
